# Python Based Ride Sharing App (PyBer) Company

## Overview
V. Isualize has given me and my associate Omar a brand-new assignment. Using our Python skills and knowledge of Pandas. Our task is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, our task is to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Final task is to submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results

* 1. The following is the summary Table giving information by type of city, such as rural, suburban and urban. For each type of city the information is given on the number of total rides, total drivers, total fares collected, average fare per ride and, finally, average fares per driver. The information shows sharp difference among the types of city and the total fares collected per drivers increases sharply by a factor of 1 to 6 between rural and suburban, and then by a factor of 1 to 2.6 between suburban and urban. Average fare collected per driver declines sharply from rural to urban, though. Thus, although, urban areas collect lot more fares than the other two types of cities, the average fare per driver declines sharply from rural to the urban areas. This implies that for commuters in urban areas the fares are far more attractive than in the rural areas if the fares are based on the cost-plus-pricing model. Alternatively, this means that in rural areas the transport may have to be subsidized to make it affordable to passengers.

* 2. The following Data Frame shows information for only 10 days on total fares by the type of city, like Rural, Suburban and Urban. The total data set has data from the first week of January of 2019 to the first week of May for 2019. As expected, urban areas collect far more fares than the rural areas.

* 3. The following graph is even more revealing about the contrasts among the three types of cities. The collection of fares is much more in urban areas than in rural areas.

## Conclusion

With this situation of rides in three types of cities my team recommends the following:

* 1 Increase the fare in suburban area by 5% to make it at almost at par with the rural area average fares.

* 2 Increase the fares in urban area by 5% with proper explanation to the commuters so protests are avoided.

* 3 Decrease the number of drivers in suburban and urban, and make changes in the route so that each driver covers more distance and stops
